* GraphQL Lab

  This is just a simple repository to record my experiments with GraphQL. To be
  honest, there is very little to see here. Most of what is in this repository
  are half baked ideas and mini-experiments which are mainly for testing and
  expanding my understanding of GraphQL. This README will be essentially a type
  of lab book with notes and results from my exploration of the GraphQL space.

** Structure

   The top level of the repository contains various housekeeping files (like
   this README) and two directories, =server= and =client=. The =server=
   directory will contain code, configuration and tests for the server
   components, including any related back-end requirements, such as databases.
   The =client= directory contains code, configuration and tests relating to
   clients which will use the GraphQL server.

*** Server

    The =server= directory contains sub-directories for =src=, =db= and =test=.
    The =src= directory contains all the Javascript sources for the server
    component. The =db= directory contains the Postgres database DDL and scripts
    to load any necessary test data. The =test= directory will contain mocha
    based tests[fn:1].

**** Database

     PostgreSQL is used as the database back-end. A database called =playground=
     has been created which the developer has full access to. A schema called
     =graphql_lab= is used inside this database to hold all the DDL relating to
     this repository. (the =playground= database is my general /catch-all/
     database for small projects like this.

     All the DDL and DML necessary to create the initial database are defined in
     scripts within the =db= directory. All scripts have a numeric prefix, used
     to control the order of execution.

**** Node Dependencies

     NPM is used to manage the node dependencies. Executing the following
     commands creates the =package.json= file and installs the initial set of
     package dependencies.

      #+begin_src shell
        npm init -y
        npm i apollo-server dotenv graphql pg
        npm i --save-dev chai mocha sinon
      #+end_src

      It is likely additional packages will be added as required.

** Notes

** Activity Log

*** <2021-02-12 Fri 08:00> Setup initial repository

   - Create basic repository structure
   - Add initial README
   - Perform initial commit
   - Install initial server dependencies
   - Setup base database

** Tasks

*** TODO Setup Postgres schema and tables
*** TODO Create database test data scripts
*** TODO Define demo application
*** TODO Setup server dependencies
*** TODO Setup client dependencies

* Footnotes

[fn:1] I am using =mocha= for testing because that is what I'm use to. However,
=jest= is probably worth investigating for React/GrphQL type projects. Add a
TODO for this for later.
